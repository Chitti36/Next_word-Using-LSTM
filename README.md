# Next_word-Using-LSTM

The project aims to develop a dl model for  predicting next word in a given sequence of words.The model is built using LSTM networks.

1-Data Collection:Text of Shakespeare's "HAMLET"(complex words)

2-Data Preprocessing-The text is tokenized,converted into seq.,paddedthen split into testingb and training

3-Model Building-LSTM with emb. layer,2 LSTM layers and dense output layer

4-Model Training-With early stopping monitoring validation loss

5-model Evaluation

6-Deployment-StreamLit.
